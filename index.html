            SHIBAHU
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>Shibahu is a vibrant and dynamic 3D anime character who exudes a playful yet confident aura. Her striking green hair styled in twin ponytails gives her a lively and adventurous appearance, complementing her expressive cat ears that hint at her mystical origins. Dressed in a modern outfit featuring a cropped jacket, shorts, and thigh-high socks, she blends contemporary streetwear with a hint of fantasy flair.</p>
            <p>The soft glow beneath her feet suggests an ethereal presence, as if sheâ€™s a guardian or a wandering spirit from another realm. Her expressive features and confident stance make her perfect for roles in a magical, futuristic, or slice-of-life anime universe.</p>
            <p>Shibahu's design is versatile, making her an ideal choice for both adventurous action scenes and charming interpersonal stories.</p>
